                    I graduated from the University of Cincinnati in 2019 with a Bachelors in Computer Engineering and a Minor in Computer Science.
                    The study of Computer Engineering at the University of Cincinnati merges all of the relevant material from Software and Electrical Engineering into one major. 
                    Throughout my co-op and professional experiences I have worked on both ends of the spectrum with little to no prior experience in either.
                    I have always been able to adapt to new stacks and techonlogies very easily.
                    This coupled with the knowledge I have gained from these experiences allows me to navigate flexibly in a world where software and hardware are becoming more interconnected.
